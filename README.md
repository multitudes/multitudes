### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Junior iOS developer based in Berlin. Love to code in Swift and currently learning SwiftUI.

Here is a link to my iOS [portfolio](https://github.com/multitudes/portfolio/blob/master/README.md)

I love cycling and good coffee. You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/wrmultitudes)

If you can't get enough of me I collected some more links [here:](https://linktr.ee/LaurentBrusa)!
