### Hi I am Laurent 👋

In 2017 I moved to Berlin and started a new career in iOS development.   
Currently I am available to hire (preferably remote at this time).   
Please have a look at my [portfolio](https://github.com/multitudes/portfolio/blob/master/README.md). 

My area of interest include:  
• Programming in Swift.  
• UIKit with both storyboards and programmatic UI.  
• Develop cross-platform native apps with SwiftUI.  

I love cycling 🚴 and good coffee ☕️🌱.
