I am a lifelong learner. My name is Laurent and I am a Junior iOS Developer based in Berlin.👨🏻‍💻   

Currently I am available to hire (preferably remote at this time).   
Please have a look at my [portfolio](https://github.com/multitudes/portfolio/blob/master/README.md). 
And at my [CV](https://multitudes.github.io/images/cv/cv-for-ios-nov2020.pdf)!

My area of interest include:  
• Programming in Swift.  
• UIKit, both with storyboards and programmatic.  
• Develop cross-platform native apps with SwiftUI.  

🌵 Fun facts:

I loved "The Queen's gambit" and started playing chess again after watching the show   
Bruce Springsteen is my favorite musician  
I am gluten intolerant, and still had a lots of fun baking sourdough bread during the lockdown
