# Hi there 👋

> “If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.”   
― John von Neumann

 
I am a lifelong learner. My name is Laurent and I am a iOS Developer based in Berlin.👨🏻‍💻   

Please have a look at my [portfolio](https://github.com/multitudes/portfolio/blob/master/README.md). 
And at my [CV](https://github.com/multitudes/multitudes.github.io/blob/master/images/cv/cv-for-ios-jun2023.pdf)!

Things that I do  
• Programming in Swift.  
• UIKit, both with storyboards and programmatic.  
• Develop cross-platform native apps with SwiftUI.  

Thank you for stopping by!
